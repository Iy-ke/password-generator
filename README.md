# Module 5 Challenge: Password Generator

## Overview
 
The aim of this project is to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on the criteria they’ve selected by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

## User Criteria

When the a button is clicked, the user gets a prompt to enter the length of the password, the password length inputed must range from 10 to 64 characters. If the number of characters is less or more. The app should display a password with randomized characters with length based on the user input.


## Acceptance Criteria
A Html file for the responsive password generator webpage, which would display a set of alpha-numeric and special characters on click of the generate button

A css styling sheet linked to the html page

A javascript linked to the html file which will run a series of functions on clicking the generate button on the webpage which would;
-ask user for length of password and generate a password with length inputed by user
-prompt the user to enter the required length of password if password doesnt have a minimum of 10 characters and a maximum of 64 characters
